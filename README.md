- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Anushka Ubriani
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Business Forecasting
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently pursuing Master in Information Technology and Analytics and looking to collaborate on Projects regarding Business Foreacsting and Analytics.
- I am using an Inflation data set for my Business Forecasting Project. Using Inflation trends we intent to use past values which will be helpful in forecasting future inflation. The data that we are using is based on Inflation as measured by the consumer price index reflecting the annual percentage change in the cost to the average consumer of acquiring a basket of goods and services that may be fixed or changed at specific intervals on yearly basis
- This is an Economic Forecast and a Point forecast.
- In order to bring out the best outcome, we will compute the accuracy of the specifications using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) = (Absolute Error/Actual Volume) * 100
- In terms of time component, this is a Long Forecast. The trends are defined annually ranging from the year 1960-2020.
